An online education website code that provide notes, test papers etc to the fellow batchmates and juniors.

Project includes coding for the following topics:
- registration (adding values to the database of MYSQL)
- login (validating the registered records)
- custom email generation for forgot password facility
- different interfaces for different types of users : reader, uploader, admin
- reader can only access the data (notes, test papers etc) using pdf reading facility from reader's table
- uploader can provide the documents and that will be stored in seperate table (uploader's table)
- admin can access all seperate tables in their interface
- all the seperate interfaces are automatically shown to resepective users by just analysing their roles (reader, uploader, admin)
- judgement of their roles is done according to their username and password

All the coding is done on Eclipse platform and MYSQL is used for the database facility. Language used is Advanced JAVA.
